Emissions from these activities have increased more than four-fold since 2019.Low-emissions energy has reduced Google‚Äôs total', 'its net carbon footprint by around 30 percent in 2023. It claims that its owned-and-operated data centers are 1.8 times more energy-efficient than a typical enterprise data center, and its sixth-generation tensor processing units (TPUs) are 67 percent more efficient than the prior generation. Google has asked its largest hardware partners to match 100 percent of their energy consumption with renewable energy 2029. The company is pursuing several AI-based initiatives to mitigate climate change from weather prediction to fuel-efficient vehicle routing. It says that AI has the potential to mitigate 5 to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Behind the news: \\xa0In 2020, after five years of successfully\\xa0 reducing \\xa0its carbon footprint, Google set an ambitious target to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But its total emissions since then have risen each year. Google‚Äôs experience mirrors that of Amazon and Microsoft, which aim to reach net-zero carbon emissions']], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'distances'], 'data': None, 'metadatas': [[{'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-international-energy-agency-examines-the-energy-costs-and-potential-savings-of-the-ai-boom/', 'title': 'The International Energy Agency Examines The Energy Costs and Potential Savings of the AI Boom', 'type': 'text'}, {'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-international-energy-agency-examines-the-energy-costs-and-potential-savings-of-the-ai-boom/', 'title': 'The International Energy Agency Examines The Energy Costs and Potential Savings of the AI Boom', 'type': 'text'}, {'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-international-energy-agency-examines-the-energy-costs-and-potential-savings-of-the-ai-boom/', 'title': 'The International Energy Agency Examines The Energy Costs and Potential Savings of the AI Boom', 'type': 'text'}, {'type': 'text', 'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\", 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/'}, {'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/', 'type': 'text', 'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\"}, {'type': 'text', 'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\", 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/'}, {'type': 'text', 'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\", 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/'}, {'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\", 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/', 'type': 'text'}, {'type': 'text', 'title': \"AI and Data Center Boom Challenges Big Tech's Emissions Targets\", 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-and-data-center-boom-challenges-big-techs-emissions-targets/'}, {'type': 'text', 'title': 'The International Energy Agency Examines The Energy Costs and Potential Savings of the AI Boom', 'source': 'https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-international-energy-agency-examines-the-energy-costs-and-potential-savings-of-the-ai-boom/'}]], 'distances': [[0.29250115156173706, 0.29250115156173706, 0.29250115156173706, 0.3493429720401764, 0.3493429720401764, 0.3493429720401764, 0.37661588191986084, 0.37661588191986084, 0.37661588191986084, 0.424465149641037]]}\n"
